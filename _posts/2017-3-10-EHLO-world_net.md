Why hello there! My name's Chris (can be Kris as well) and this is another attempt of mine at creating a blog-wannabe where I could put my thoughts and ideas.

What will I post here? I'll probably write about CTF challenges, possibly some security stuff and programming experiences. As I don't have that much experience in the security field, for now I'll stick with CTFs and programming.
Please bear in mind that this is also an attempt to boost my writing skills (both in English and overall) so you might find some mistakes. I'd like to apologize for those in advance ;-)

See you soon!
