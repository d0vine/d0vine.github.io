As someone once said - `another weekend, another CTF`! This time our team - `Shellraisers` - participated in the `Hackover18 CTF` competition and we ended up at the 5th place, w00tw00t! Gotta say we did a great job as a team and if not for the cooperation, the place could've not been that good ;)

In my opinion, the CTF - although great! - was a tad unbalanced. Some tasks, despite being worth 500 points, were easy, while some seemed impossible! But hey, who knows - maybe it's just our specialisation (of each of the team members) speaking.

I will definitely post some write-ups here and there (on this blog and ctftime, at least), so stay tuned!

Cheers!
