### $ whoami

こんにちは！ My name's Kris (Christopher, but I like the abbreviation more) and it seems I'm 26 years old at the moment of writing. I've graduated the [Poznań University of Technology](https://www.put.poznan.pl/en) majoring in Networking and Distributed Systems and now I work at a certain cyber-security company as a security consultant.

### Hobbies: :computer: :unlock: :book: :saxophone:

As you have probably figured out I like computers but that's not the only hobby I have (although one could argue whether that's a single hobby or not). I read quite a lot of books (mostly fantasy/horror [Lovecraft :green_heart:]), cook (when I'm not lazy enough) and play saxophone. I also used to do some gamedev stuff although I found it a tad less enjoyable at some point and thus stopped doing it at all.

### Contact me

You can meet me at a few IRC channels (usually @hun7err or @_0kami) at Freenode, IRCnet and PIRC (the oldschool way), but if you want to drop an e-mail please write to:

[contact (at) kmarciniak.com](mailto:contact (at) kmarciniak.com)

[Here's](/contact_kmarciniak_pubkey.asc) my public key in case you want to encrypt the e-mail you send.
